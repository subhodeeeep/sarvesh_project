Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner.

<h2>History</h2>
  <p>The popularity of sports increased during the Renaissance, and rules began to form to make the games fairer. Sports clubs and associations became more common, especially for elite sports. Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought motorised transportation and increased leisure time, letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes â€“ all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the turn of the 21st century, there has been increasing debate about whether transgender sports people should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transition gender identity</p>
